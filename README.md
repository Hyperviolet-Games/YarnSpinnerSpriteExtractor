# YarnSpriteExtractor
 Run this on a folder containing [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) files to recursively
generate the names of all sprites specified by the command
`<<setSprite Character spritename>>`
within those files

```$ python . /Path/To/Your/Game/Assets/Dialogue > out.md```

This is extremely bare bones so use at your own risk
